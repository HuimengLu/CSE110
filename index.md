# Hi! Welcome to Huimeng's User Page
## I practice Markdown here
### Part 1: Trying some Markdown constructs

My name is Huimeng or you can call me **Cynthia**. I'm a junior undergrad at **Seventh College**. I watched _Dune2_ last week and it was fantastic! ~~Although I do think Timothee Chalamet was prettier in the last movie.~~

Anyways, ***welcome to my creative space!***

Let me try using a <sub>subscript</sub> text and a <sup>superscript</sup> text. Cool!

My fav quote is:

> Design is really an act of communication, which means having a deep understanding of the person with whom the designer is communicating.

I've also learned some new Git commands, such as:
```
git clone
git status
git add
git commit
```

Anyways, if you want to learn more about me, you can always check out [my design portfolio](https://www.huimenglu.com/) or jump to the [start](#i-practice-markdown-here)!

For more about the repository, you can go to [README file for this project](README.md).
